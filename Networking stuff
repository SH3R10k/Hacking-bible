This blog focuses on network traffic related to malware infections, includes Wireshark and Security Onion.
With downloadable examples for traffic analysis one needs to beware of the fact that there is real malware in the examples,
hence I wouldn't recommend downloading the resources directly to your main machine.
[FOR BEGINNERS] SOME OF THE LABS MAY INCLUDE REAL MALWARE EXECUTABLES, so stick to the "PCAP" files for starters for your own safety.
